# Waggle-PowerBI
Waggle - a startup company that makes smart devices for pets - wants to issue a new Lapcat device after the success of the lapdog device which is a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas. This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability.
For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, we have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.

**The CEO is curious about the following questions:**
* Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
* Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

**Important Notes**
* The brand instructed to use their logo and color palettes for the report.
* The brand instructed to focus on visualizations to highlight insights and other findings from the dataset.
* There is a time gap between the Lapdog data which is dated back to 2018 and the Lapcat data which begins in 2020.

Below screenshots are of the final submitted report:

# Project/Report:
After inspecting the data, we determined it was clean and did not require any further amendments. Then we proceeded with answering the CEO's first question, which was to find if there were any noticeable differences in the average daily steps between the cats and the dogs. Since we already have the tracking data that monitors their daily steps; we were able to create a visualization board (Line Chart) to do the needed comparison.

Upon inspecting the graph, we can determine there is a significant variance between both of the devices. Although the history record for Lapcat device data begins at a much later date than the Lapdog data, we can still perceive the data variation at the recent time. 

In order to assist with navigating the data, we added a slicer panel to help with filtering any specific information.

For the CEO's next question, we analyzed the device rating data and created the visuals necessary to provide clear insights into customer feedback (Line, Pie and bar charts).

As a result of these visualizations, we were able to paint a clear picture of the interactions and reviews of the customers, and we concluded that the owners of the Lapdog device were more positively interactive than the owners of the Lapcat device.
