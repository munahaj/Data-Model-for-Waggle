# Waggle-PowerBI
Waggle - a startup company that makes smart devices for pets - wants to issue a new Lapcat device after the success of the lapdog device which was a fitness collar that lets owners track their dog’s steps, alerts them when it’s time for a walk, and even repels fleas. This success has led Waggle’s CEO to push for a feline version but there are concerns about its viability.
For this reason, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing. Now, after months of data collection, we have been tasked with delivering a boardroom-ready Power BI report that tells the story of how the Lapcat data compares to findings from the dog collar Lapdog devices.

**The CEO is curious about the following questions:**
* Did the average daily steps increase for cats wearing the device as they did for dogs?
* Were owners of Lapcat devices as satisfied with the product as Lapdog owners?

**Important Notes**
* The brands instructed to use their logo and color palettes for the report
